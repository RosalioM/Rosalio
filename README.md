# 👋 Hey, I’m Rosalio

[![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://linkedin.com/in/rosaliomayo)

I’m a cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience in offensive and defensive security. I completed the Cybersecurity Professional Program at the University of Colorado Boulder and hold a CompTIA Security+ certification. I’ve worked through 50+ labs and real-world projects involving network security, threat detection, penetration testing, and digital forensics.

I enjoy digging into traffic logs, hunting threats, breaking vulnerable systems (legally), and building stronger defenses. I'm fluent in English and Spanish and always open to new challenges in cybersecurity.

## 🚀 What I’m Focused On

- Threat detection, incident response, and SIEM tools like Splunk and Sentinel  
- Penetration testing and red teaming with Kali, Burp Suite, and Python  
- Blue team operations, including traffic analysis and host forensics  
- Securing critical infrastructure systems in ICS/OT environments

## 🔧 Projects

### 🔹 Web App Pentest (TCM Security)
Tested vulnerable web apps for OWASP Top 10 flaws using Burp Suite, Hydra, SQLmap, and other tools. Mapped out and exploited attack surfaces using manual and automated techniques.

### 🔹 SOC Simulation (TryHackMe)
Worked in a mock SOC to analyze alerts, investigate threats, and respond to attacks using SIEM and EDR platforms.

### 🔹 Snort IDS Build
Deployed and configured Snort as a network intrusion detection system. Wrote custom rules, analyzed traffic, and tested against attack simulations.

### 🔹 Active Directory Lab (Local VM)
Created an enterprise-style AD environment and executed attacks including lateral movement, privilege escalation, and post-exploitation cleanup.

### 🔹 ICS/OT Security Testing
Simulated ICS attacks using Modbus traffic and packet captures. Wrote Python scripts to analyze unencrypted control commands and exposed devices. Focused on securing critical infrastructure systems and identifying real-world attack paths in SCADA networks.
